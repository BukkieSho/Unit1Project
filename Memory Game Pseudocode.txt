Game Objective:
Match flipped cards from brain memory.

Rules of Memory Game
Game starts with a 3 x 4 grid of blank-cards flipped over
Player starts by flipping over one card to reveal a picture on the card face.
Then flips over another card.
If the next card flipped matches the first one, a pop up shows +1 score
These cards then get whitened out and cannot be clicked again.
If the next flipped card does not match the first flipped card, player is notified.
All cards go back to blank-flipped.
Game continues until all the cards on the grid are matched.

Functions I will use for this:
 for loops
 addEventListener
 document.querySelector
 get and setAttrribute

 I will also do a bit of css styling for aesthethics.
 Images will be uploaded from Google search or unsplash.com
